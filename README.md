# paya

**Paya** is a patch for PyMEL to overcome the limitations of the
[virtual classes](https://github.com/LumaPictures/pymel/blob/master/examples/customClasses.py) system. It unlocks
customisation for component, attribute (including subtype) and data classes, implements true inheritance and offers a
simpler authoring  workflow with full support for techniques such as operator overloading.
