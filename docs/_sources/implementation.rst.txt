There are two aspects to the **paya** patching mechanism.

1. Class Construction
---------------------

Custom **paya** classes are built in the following way:

    1.  Where available, content is taken from user (or bundled)
        :ref:`template classes <template_classes>`.

    2.  The custom classes are then built using special metaclasses that
        manage inheritance via an overriden :meth:`~paya.pools.payaMeta.mro`.

Custom node, component and data types always shadow a PyMEL counterpart in the method resolution order. However, when it
comes to **plug** (attribute) types, PyMEL only provides one class: :py:class:`pymel.core.general.Attribute`. For this
reason, custom plug types are derived from an abstract inheritance tree served by :mod:`paya.plugtree`.

2. Instance Interception
------------------------

``__new__()`` constructors on PyMEL classes inside :py:mod:`pymel.core.general`, :py:mod:`pymel.core.nodetypes` and
:py:mod:`pymel.core.datatypes` are then dynamically replaced with wrappers that capture the original
:class:`~pymel.core.general.PyNode` instance, look up a relevant custom class, and assign it directly to the
``__class__`` attribute of the instance.

Lookups are cached throughout.

Advantages
----------

-   **Speed**: Re-instantiating PyNodes is notoriously slow, and therefore avoided entirely.

-   **Easy coupling / decoupling**: Unpatching PyMEL is merely a case of
    removing the ``__new__()`` wrappers.

-   **Compatibility**: PyMEL treats custom objects as its own.

-   **Simpler Customisation**: Inheritance is managed entirely during the
    rebuilding stage; users do not need to track it for class declarations.

Disadvantages
-------------

-   Because PyMEL patching is persistent, it's incumbent on the developer to ensure their customisations won't break
    external pipeline code by overriding common PyMEL methods and / or to :ref:`apply patching in a controlled way
    <Bracketing>`.

-   Paya slows down PyMEL by 13% at most.
