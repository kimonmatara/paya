You can pick up much of Paya just browsing for methods. The :doc:`Types </types_index>` appendix is a good starting
point. To get the same information contextually within Maya, call :func:`help` on any Paya class:

.. code-block:: python

    import paya.runtime as r

    with r:
        transform = r.group(empty=True)
        transformClass = type(transform)
        help(transformClass)

To look for a method based on a hunch, use :func:`dir` instead:

.. code-block:: python

    with r:
        for name in dir(transformClass):
            if 'offset' in name.lower():
                print(name)

        # Result: createOffsetGroups

After you've snooped around for a while, visit :doc:`Idioms </docs/idioms>` for workflow ideas.
