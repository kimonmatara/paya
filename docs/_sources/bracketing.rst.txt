Bracketing
**********

Recall that, once patched, PyMEL will continue to return custom Paya classes until :meth:`paya.runtime.Runtime.stop`
is called. For this reason, new versions of Paya are carefully written to add functionality without modifying any



Bundled Paya classes add functionality without modifying any standard methods they inherit from PyMEL's own classes.






If you have customised Paya yourself, you should consider 'bracketing' your build scripts with calls to
:py:meth:`~paya.runtime.Runtime.stop` and :py:meth:`~paya.runtime.Runtime.start`
