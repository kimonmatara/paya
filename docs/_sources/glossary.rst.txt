    Dynamic
        A class, method or workflow that deals with numeric Maya attributes rather than values. The following
        statement is dynamic, because it applies the ``+`` operator directly to Maya attributes, generating an
        ``addDoubleLinear`` node:

        .. code-block:: python

            tx = loc1.attr('tx') + loc2.attr('tx')

    Static
        A class, method or workflow that deals with numeric Maya values rather than attributes. The following
        statement is static, because it applies the ``+`` operator to the retrieved values of two Maya attributes,
        rather than the attributes themselves:

        .. code-block:: python

            tx = loc1.attr('tx').get() + loc2.attr('tx').get()

    Universal
        Describes functionality that has been implemented for values (static) as well as attributes (dynamic), for
        example the method :meth:`paya.runtime.data.Matrix.decompose` /
        :meth:`paya.runtime.plugs.Matrix.decompose` or the function :func:`paya.runtime.createMatrix`.
