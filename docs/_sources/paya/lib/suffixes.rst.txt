.. py:module:: paya.lib.suffixes

Administers type suffixes of the kind typically found in Maya pipelines. These
are defined inside ``paya/lib/suffixes.json``, and are derived from the 'tags'
in the `Maya Module Index <https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2023/ENU/?guid=__Nodes_index_html>`_.

Suffixes are applied according to this rule:

-   If the node is a transform, then:

    -   If the node has a shape, the lookup is the shape's node type
    -   Otherwise, the lookup is the transform's node type

-   Otherwise:

    -   If the node is a shape, no suffix is applied
    -   Otherwise, the lookup is the shape's node type

Once read, suffixes are held in the ``suffixes`` global variable of this
module.

.. py:function:: getKeyFromNode(node)

    Given a Maya node, returns the appropriate key to use for suffix lookups.
    
    If the node is a (strict) transform then, if it has a shape, the shape's
    node type will be returned. If it doesn't have a shape, 'transform' will
    be returned.
    
    If the node is not a transform then, if it's a shape, None will be
    returned. If it's not a shape, the node's type will be returned.
    
    :param node: the node to inspect
    :type node: PyNode or str
    :return: The suffix lookup.
    :rtype: str

.. py:function:: load()

    Loads suffixes from ``suffixes.json``.

.. py:function:: dump()

    Dumps suffixes into ``suffixes.json``.

.. py:function:: learnFromHelp(htmlpath)

    Populates the suffixes dict from a dumped Maya help file.
    
    To use this:
    
        -   Navigate to the Maya 'nodes index' page
        -   Turn on 'tags'
        -   Dump the main frame source code into an html file
        -   Pass the file path to this method
    
    To make changes permanent, call :func:`dump` afterwards.
    
    :param str htmlpath: the path to the saved html file

.. py:function:: getFromName(name)

    Extracts a type suffix from a node name.
    
    :param str name: the name to inspect
    :return: The extracted suffix, if any.

.. py:function:: learnFromScene()

    Learns suffixes from node names in the current scene. To make changes
    permanent, call :func:`dump` afterwards.
