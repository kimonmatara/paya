.. py:module:: paya.lib.loopback

Internal. Implements the geometry loopbacks.

.. py:class:: Loopback

    Used to reappropriate geometry plug methods as shape methods. The plug
    methods are copied over to the shape, and wrapped so that they generate
    shapes instead of output plugs. In some cases the calling shape itself
    will be replaced.
    
    :Example:
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        class NurbsCurve:
    
            attach = Loopback()
            detach = Loopback()
