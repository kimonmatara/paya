    Create two anchor-bezier
    Draw controls at the anchors
    Drive the bezier with the controls; use the controls to add up vector information
    
    
    
    Subdivide previous to get three-point bezier. This is the 'platform'
    Draw inner controls
    For each control:
        Get a matrix at the matching inner platform anchor, use it to drive the control
        (including tangent stretch)
    
    Create an offset curve
    Cluster internal anchors to the inner controls
    For the outer anchors:
        Get tangent from platform curve
        Get up vector and position from root bounds controls
        Drive with matrices
